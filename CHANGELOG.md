# Changelog

All notable changes to @rpamis/comet will be documented in this file.

## What's Changed [0.3.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- **Dirty worktree recovery protocol**: Added shared English and Chinese `comet/reference/dirty-worktree.md` references so agents consistently protect, inspect, and attribute user or mixed-source working tree changes during resume

### Changed

- **Comet resume behavior**: Updated `/comet`, build, verify, hotfix, and tweak skills so manual code edits made during interruptions are treated as code evidence, not automatic state transitions; agents must attribute dirty worktree changes before continuing or advancing guards

### Fixed

- **Reference skill installation**: Added the dirty worktree reference file to the Comet manifest so installed English and Chinese skill sets can resolve `comet/reference/dirty-worktree.md`

## What's Changed [0.2.9] - 2026-05-24

### Changed

- **Antigravity skill paths**: Updated platform handling so project-scope installs use `.agents/skills` while global installs use Antigravity's `.gemini/antigravity/skills` location, keeping `init`, `doctor`, and `update` aligned with Antigravity's directory model
- **README information architecture**: Reworked English and Chinese README sections so command details, platform lists, skill tables, script tables, `.comet.yaml` fields, and reliability notes are available in collapsible reference panels
- **Spec lifecycle documentation**: Expanded the README explanation of Comet's Spec lifecycle management, including OpenSpec/Superpowers artifact linking, automated handoff, state updates, validation, and archive sync
- **Security guidance location**: Moved repository maintenance security notes from README into `CONTRIBUTING.md`, keeping the README focused on user-facing Comet concepts and setup

### Fixed

- **Antigravity global installs**: Fixed `comet init --scope global` and related health checks so Antigravity no longer installs or searches global skills under the project-style `.agents` directory
- **Missing skills directories**: Added explicit existence checks before scanning project and global skills directories, keeping detection and update logic robust when platform directories exist without `skills/`

### Tests

- **Antigravity path coverage**: Added regression coverage for Antigravity project/global skill directories across detection and init E2E behavior
- **README structure coverage**: Verified the updated README command and reference structure with the existing README test suite

## What's Changed [0.2.8] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- **Design handoff script**: New `comet-handoff.sh` generates deterministic, source-traceable context packages (compact or full mode) from OpenSpec artifacts into `.comet/handoff/`, recording `handoff_context` and `handoff_hash` in `.comet.yaml`
- **Handoff guard checks**: Design phase guard now validates handoff context existence, hash freshness (detects post-handoff OpenSpec mutations), markdown traceability markers, and design doc frontmatter fields (`comet_change`, `role: technical-design`, `canonical_spec: openspec`)
- **`handoff_context` and `handoff_hash` fields**: New `.comet.yaml` fields for tracking script-generated handoff packages, with schema validation (path existence, sha256 hex digest format)
- **`comet init --scope`**: New `--scope <global|project>` CLI flag for non-interactive scope selection
- **CI init E2E job**: GitHub Actions now runs real `comet init` on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows, verifying Comet skills, Superpowers, OpenSpec, and working directories land in correct filesystem locations for both project and global scope

### Changed

- **Chinese skill docs updated**: `comet-design/SKILL.md` and `comet/SKILL.md` now document the handoff flow, replacing agent-authored summaries with script-generated context packs
- **JSON generation uses process substitution**: `write_json_context` in `comet-handoff.sh` uses `< <(source_files)` instead of pipe subshell, fixing variable scoping
- **Error message formatting**: `comet-state.sh` unknown-field error message split from a single 270+ character line into multiple lines for readability
- **CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md**: Added project-level instructions covering test commands, shell script conventions, script dependency graph, `.comet.yaml` state machine sync rules, and changelog format

### Fixed

- **YAML and frontmatter parsing**: Comet scripts now ignore unquoted trailing comments in `.comet.yaml` field values and accept Design Doc frontmatter after a UTF-8 BOM or leading blank lines, preventing false guard and handoff failures
- **Init E2E install checks**: CI now verifies Comet-owned skill artifacts in every supported platform directory and checks OpenSpec/Superpowers installer status from `comet init --json` for both project and global installs, avoiding false failures from external CLI-specific directory layouts
- **Windows global init E2E home directory**: CI now sets `USERPROFILE` alongside `HOME` for global-scope init checks on Windows, matching Node's `os.homedir()` resolution and preventing false missing-skill failures
- **README state documentation**: README examples now show accurate `.comet.yaml` build-state defaults, verification evidence timing, handoff fields, and project-only working directory creation

### Tests

- Added coverage for `--full` handoff mode, missing OpenSpec artifacts rejection, post-handoff hash mismatch detection, and design doc frontmatter validation
- Added `comet init` E2E tests covering project scope install, global scope install, skip-existing with `--yes`, overwrite with `--overwrite`, and multi-platform detection
- Added regression coverage for `.comet.yaml` trailing comments and Design Doc frontmatter with a UTF-8 BOM or leading blank lines
- Added CI workflow regression coverage for project and global installation checks across Comet-owned files and external OpenSpec/Superpowers installer statuses
- Added CI workflow regression coverage for Windows global init using the temporary `USERPROFILE` home directory

## What's Changed [0.2.7] - 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- **OpenSpec global init**: `comet init` global scope now passes the home directory as OpenSpec's init target instead of using the unsupported `openspec init --global` flag
- **Cross-platform path quoting**: OpenSpec init targets are shell-quoted for Windows, macOS, and Linux paths, including home directories with spaces
- **Installer argument quoting**: OpenSpec `--tools` values and Superpowers `--agent` values are now shell-quoted, and Windows OpenSpec paths preserve trailing backslashes before the closing quote
- **Superpowers multi-platform install**: Superpowers installation now passes repeated `--agent` flags instead of a comma-separated agent list, matching the `skills` CLI behavior
- **Superpowers agent mappings**: Updated Comet platform mappings to valid `skills` CLI agent IDs, with unsupported platform-specific IDs falling back to `universal`

### Tests

- Added regression coverage for OpenSpec global init command construction across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Added regression coverage for OpenSpec Windows trailing-backslash quoting and quoted installer arguments
- Added Superpowers coverage for valid `skills` CLI agent mappings and multi-agent argument formatting
- Smoke-tested project and global initialization outputs for all 28 supported platforms in isolated temporary directories

## What's Changed [0.2.6] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- **Build decision enforcement**: Build guard and `comet-state.sh transition build-complete` now require `isolation` and `build_mode` before moving from build to verify
- **Direct mode override**: Full workflows must set `direct_override: true` before using `build_mode: direct`; hotfix/tweak remain allowed by default
- **Configurable guard commands**: Guard scripts now read `build_command` and `verify_command` from the change `.comet.yaml` or repo-root Comet config before falling back to auto-detected build commands
- **Archive diff preview**: Archive sync prints a unified diff before overwriting an existing main spec when it differs from the delta spec
- **Cross-platform script smoke CI**: Added Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows smoke coverage for Comet shell scripts and portable shell tests
- **Shell line-ending policy**: Added `.gitattributes` rules to keep shell and Bats scripts on LF endings

### Changed

- **Guard failure output**: Guard checks now preserve and print command failure output, plus actionable `Next:` hints for missing build decisions and unfinished tasks
- **Command handling**: Project commands run through `bash -lc`, Maven uses `mvnw` or `mvn.cmd` where appropriate, and Windows Git Bash paths are handled in shell test helpers
- **Archive step counting**: Dry-run, delta sync, annotation, move, and archive status steps now count real executed steps without double-counting repeated operations
- **English docs and skills**: Synced the English README and Comet skill text with the Chinese build-decision, command-config, and archive behavior descriptions

### Fixed

- **macOS shell script state updates**: Replaced GNU-only `sed -i` writes in `comet-state.sh` with portable temp-file updates, fixing macOS CI failures during `scale`, `transition`, and YAML field updates
- **Optional field reads under pipefail**: Guard and state scripts now tolerate missing optional YAML fields without exiting early under `set -euo pipefail`
- **Bash detection fallback**: Shell test helpers now handle failed `bash` probes without crashing on empty `spawnSync` output
- **Configured command persistence**: `comet-state.sh set` now escapes sed replacement metacharacters so command values containing `&`, `|`, or backslashes are preserved
- **Optional schema fields**: YAML validation now recognizes `direct_override`, `build_command`, and `verify_command`
- **Quoted YAML values**: State, guard, and validator scripts now strip only wrapping quotes instead of deleting all quote characters from values

### Tests

- Added coverage for missing build decisions, direct-mode override blocking and allowance, configured build/verify commands, command metacharacter preservation, unfinished-task remediation output, archive step counts, cross-platform path handling, BSD/GNU sed portability, optional YAML field reads under `pipefail`, and failed bash probe handling

## What's Changed [0.2.5] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- **PR title lint workflow**: Added GitHub Actions validation for semantic PR titles with Comet-specific scopes (`cli`, `commands`, `core`, `skills`, `assets`, `scripts`, `docs`, `ci`, `deps`, `release`)
- **Structured JSON output**: `comet init --json` and `comet update --json` now emit machine-readable results instead of mixed human logs
- **`doctor --scope`**: `comet doctor` can diagnose `auto`, `project`, or `global` scope, with `auto` checking both project and global installs
- **Next-step status hint**: `comet status` now reports the next workflow command (`/comet-open`, `/comet-design`, `/comet-build`, `/comet-verify`, `/comet-archive`) in text and JSON output
- **README asset guard**: Added tests and prepublish validation to keep README images on npm-friendly absolute URLs

### Changed

- **`comet update` preserves installed context**: Update now detects existing Comet skill targets across project/global scopes, preserves installed scope, detects Chinese vs English skills, and updates only platforms where Comet skills are already installed
- **`comet update` self-updates npm package**: Update now prints and runs the matching npm update command for the detected package scope before refreshing installed skills
- **Friendlier update output**: Update logs the npm command, per-target skill copy command, final npm status, updated target count, scope, and language summary
- **Init overwrite flow**: Interactive `comet init` now offers a bulk overwrite/skip choice when multiple existing components are detected on the same platform
- **CLI option validation**: `update --language`, `update --scope`, and `doctor --scope` now validate accepted values through Commander choices
- **README CLI docs**: Updated English and Chinese README command sections to document JSON output, doctor scope, update behavior, status next-step hints, and init overwrite behavior
- **CONTRIBUTING link**: Added contribution guide references to both English and Chinese README development sections

### Fixed

- **Doctor false positives**: `comet doctor` now recognizes current `.comet.yaml` fields including `verification_report` and `branch_status`
- **npm README images**: README images now use absolute GitHub URLs so package pages can render them

### Tests

- Added coverage for update language/scope detection, JSON output, friendly command display, status next-step hints, doctor current-state validation, README image URLs, init bulk overwrite selection, and PR title workflow configuration

## What's Changed [0.2.4] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Verification evidence enforcement**: `verify-pass` transition now requires `verification_report` (file must exist) and `branch_status: handled` before allowing phase advance. Guard checks these as hard prerequisites
- **`verification_report` and `branch_status` fields** in `.comet.yaml`: New state fields track verification report path and branch handling status
- **Verification evidence step** in comet-verify (zh): New Step 4 requiring report file creation and branch status recording before guard apply
- **`branch_status` enum validation**: `comet-state.sh set` validates `branch_status` as `pending` or `handled`
- **Guard verify checks**: `comet-guard.sh` now checks `verification_report exists` and `branch_status=handled` during verify phase
- **Bats test CRLF fix**: Shell tests strip `\r` from scripts before execution, fixing Windows compatibility
- **`test:shell` runner**: Replaced direct `bats` call with `node scripts/run-bats.js` for cross-platform support

### Changed

- **Hotfix root cause check reordered**: Moved root cause elimination check **before** comet-verify loading (Step 3a → 3b split), preventing it from being skipped during verify flow
- **Hotfix header description simplified**: Replaced ambiguous "not a separate parallel process" with direct "Quick bug fix workflow" for standalone invocation clarity
- **Removed non-action steps from comet-design**: Deleted Step 3 (Dual Spec Division table) and Step 4 (Document Hierarchy) — pure reference material with no agent actions
- **Removed duplicate script location blocks**: comet-open (Step 3) and comet-archive (Step 1) no longer repeat the full `COMET_SEARCH_ROOTS` find block when variables already cached
- **Removed duplicate 50% threshold in comet-build**: Single mention in threshold determination table instead of table + bullet repetition
- **Generic error handling**: Error table in comet main skill changed "Maven compile/test" → "Build/test" for language-agnostic wording
- **comet-state.sh usage help**: Fixed `check` parameter order in help text (`check <change-name> <phase>`)

### Fixed

- **comet-state.sh `init` change directory resolution**: `cmd_init` now resolves `change_dir` before checking if `.comet.yaml` already exists, fixing path resolution for nested directories
- **Guard deadlock on verify**: `verify-pass` transition now resets `verification_report` and `branch_status` when rolling back via `verify-fail`, preventing stale evidence from allowing false transitions

### Tests

- **+66 lines** in `comet-scripts.test.ts`: New tests for verification evidence blocking, branch status validation, and guard verify with evidence
- **+12 lines** in `comet-state.bats`: New tests for `branch_status` enum validation, CRLF stripping, and new field presence in init output

## What's Changed [0.2.3] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- **"Why Comet" section**: README now explains the rationale behind Comet — how it combines OpenSpec's WHAT management with Superpowers' HOW execution into a unified 5-phase pipeline
- **"Screenshots" section**: Added three screenshots demonstrating platform selection, initialization, and skill execution in action
- **"What You'll Learn" section**: New section showcasing Comet as a reference for stable nested skill triggering and multi-phase auto-flow patterns
- **State Management YAML example**: Extended documentation with complete `.comet.yaml` field example showing all key configuration values

### Changed

- **comet-build skill description**: Clarified that execution mode (subagent vs executing-plans) is user-selectable based on task complexity, not always subagent-driven
- **Enhanced State Management docs**: Added explanation of how all states and phases are updated via scripts with completion validation before phase transitions

## What's Changed [0.2.2] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- **Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+C crash during `comet init`**: Wrapped inquirer prompts in try/catch to handle `ExitPromptError`, showing `Cancelled.` and exiting cleanly instead of printing a raw stack trace
- **Duplicate Superpowers installation**: `comet init` now detects Superpowers installed via Claude Code plugin system (`~/.claude/plugins/cache/`), skipping redundant `npx skills add` when Superpowers plugin is already present

## What's Changed [0.2.1] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- **CI pnpm version**: Added `packageManager` field for pnpm/action-setup v4
- **Shell scripts**: Fixed `SCRIPT_DIR` typo, renamed `maven_compiles` → `build_passes` (language-agnostic), fixed `check_nonempty` path bug, fixed `cmd_set` sed delimiter for path values, corrected shellcheck directive placement
- **Node version**: Bumped minimum to Node 20 (vitest v4 coverage requires `node:inspector/promises`)

## What's Changed [0.2.0] - 2026-05-18

Comet 0.2.0 is a comprehensive optimization release: skill reliability, CLI completeness, and engineering quality.

### Skill Reliability

- **SKILL.md two-zone structure**: All 8 skills split into "Decision Core" (phase detection, upgrade criteria, error handling) and "Reference Appendix" (field reference, scripts, best practices)
- **Quantified upgrade criteria**: Hotfix/tweak now define explicit thresholds for upgrading to full workflow (file count, cross-module coordination, architecture changes, etc.)
- **Script location caching**: All skills use `${VAR:-$(find ...)}` env-var cache pattern, avoiding repeated `find` calls
- **`manifest.json` fixed**: Added missing `comet-state.sh` and `comet-archive.sh` entries
- **`comet-state.sh init` fixed**: Now writes `workflow` field to `.comet.yaml`, fixing `check design` which always failed

### CLI Commands

- **`comet status`**: Show active changes with phase, task progress, workflow mode, design doc, and plan (`--json` supported)
- **`comet doctor`**: Diagnose installation health — OpenSpec CLI, working directories, skill completeness per platform, script presence, `.comet.yaml` validity (`--json` supported)
- **`comet update`**: Update comet skill files to latest version from npm package (`--language`, `--scope` supported)
- **`--json` on all commands**: `init`, `status`, `doctor`, `update` all accept structured output

### Engineering

- **Test suite**: 54 unit tests (5 suites) with 93.8% statement / 100% function coverage; 26 bats shell tests
- **GitHub Actions CI**: Build + lint + format + test (Node 18/20/22) + shellcheck + bats on push/PR
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Code quality tooling with `pnpm lint` / `pnpm format`
- **Code organization**: Monolithic `init.ts` (620 lines) split into 5 focused core modules + 4 command modules
- **Command injection hardening**: Platform/tool ID validation before shell command construction
- **Per-file error handling**: Copy loop continues past individual file failures

## What's Changed [0.1.8] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- **`comet-state.sh` script**: Unified state management with 5 subcommands — `init` (create .comet.yaml), `set` (update with enum validation), `get` (read field), `check` (entry verification), `scale` (verification mode assessment)
- **`check` subcommand**: Scripted entry verification replacing text checklists in all 8 skills
- **`scale` subcommand**: Scripted scale assessment replacing prose decision rules in comet-verify

### Changed

- **All `.comet.yaml` writes go through `comet-state.sh`**: No more raw `sed -i` — enum validation on every field write
- **All skill Step 0 checklists replaced with `check` subcommand**: Single command replaces text-based entry verification
- **`comet-guard.sh` and `comet-archive.sh` use state.sh internally**: All state mutations through unified interface
- **Removed write-verification blocks**: hotfix and tweak presets no longer have manual verification loops

## What's Changed [0.1.7] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- **`comet-archive.sh` script**: One-command archive automation — validates entry state, syncs delta specs to main specs (overwrite), annotates design doc and plan frontmatter, moves change to archive directory, updates `archived: true`. Supports `--dry-run` for preview
- **`--apply` mode for `comet-guard.sh`**: Opt-in flag that auto-updates `.comet.yaml` state fields after all guard checks pass. No manual state editing required during phase transitions
- **Idempotent frontmatter annotation**: `annotate_frontmatter()` skips existing `archived-with:` lines, safe to re-run

### Changed

- **Removed manual state editing**: All phase transitions (design → build → verify → archive) now use `guard --apply` instead of manual `.comet.yaml` field updates and write-verification loops
- **Removed write-verification blocks**: Eliminated all `【写入验证】` / `【Write verification】` patterns from comet-open, comet-design, comet-build, comet-verify, and comet-archive skills
- **Removed `## ADDED`/`## MODIFIED`/`## REMOVED` delta format**: Delta specs are now complete specs; archive overwrites main spec instead of merging fragments
- **Removed step 2b from comet-open**: Incremental modification of existing capabilities is just a new `/comet-open` — brainstorming reads existing specs as context naturally
- **Simplified archive skill**: Steps 1b–5 replaced with single `comet-archive.sh` call
- **Updated `comet/SKILL.md`**: Script location section now documents both `--apply` mode and archive script

### Removed

- Few-shot YAML examples for `isolation`, `build_mode`, `verify_mode` fields (redundant with agent judgment)
- `openspec-archive-change` skill dependency from comet-archive (archive script handles all steps)

## What's Changed [0.1.6] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- **Workspace Isolation Selection**: `comet-build` now prompts users to choose between creating a branch or a worktree before execution begins (Step 3: Workspace Isolation)
- **`isolation` field in `.comet.yaml`**: New required field (`branch` or `worktree`) to record the user's workspace isolation choice
- **`isolation` enum validation**: `comet-yaml-validate.sh` now validates `isolation` as a required field with allowed values `branch`/`worktree`

### Changed

- `comet-build` step numbering: Step 3 (Select Execution Method) → Step 4, Step 4 (Spec Incremental Updates) → Step 5
- Hotfix and tweak presets default to `isolation: branch` without prompting
- `comet-yaml-validate.sh` `REQUIRED_FIELDS` and `KNOWN_KEYS` updated to include `isolation`

## What's Changed [0.1.5] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- **Bilingual Comet skills**: `comet init` now prompts for language selection (English / 中文) and deploys the corresponding SKILL.md files
- **Language-aware asset structure**: English skills in `assets/skills/`, Chinese skills in `assets/skills-zh/`
- **`languages` field in manifest.json**: Maps language IDs to asset directories for future extensibility

### Changed

- All 8 Comet SKILL.md files in `assets/skills/` are now English (Chinese originals preserved in `assets/skills-zh/`)
- `copyCometSkillsForPlatform` accepts `languageSkillsDir` parameter; script files always sourced from default `skills/` directory
- `--yes` mode defaults to English language selection

## What's Changed [0.1.4] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed

- **Superpowers redundant project-level install**: `comet init` now checks the global directories (`~/{platform}/skills/`) of all user-selected platforms before installing Superpowers. If Superpowers is already installed globally for any selected platform, the project-level install is skipped
- **Unwanted `.agents/` directory creation**: `comet init` now passes `--agent` flag to `skills add`, targeting only the platforms the user selected. This prevents the skills CLI from auto-detecting and installing to all platforms, which previously created an unnecessary `.agents/` directory
- **OpenSpec global detection**: Same global-directory fallback logic applied to OpenSpec detection, avoiding redundant OpenSpec installs when already present globally for selected platforms

### Changed

- `hasSkills()` accepts `selectedPlatforms` parameter to scope global detection to user-chosen platforms only
- `installSuperpowersForPlatform()` replaced with `installSuperpowersForPlatforms()` that accepts platform IDs and maps them to skills CLI agent names via `SKILLS_AGENT_MAP`

## What's Changed [0.1.3] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- **State File Separation**: Comet workflow state now stored in independent `.comet.yaml` file instead of `.openspec.yaml` subtree
- **Three-Layer Reliability Defense**:
  - Entry verification for all phases with `[HARD STOP]` diagnostics
  - Write-then-verify pattern for all state mutations
  - Schema validator script (`comet-yaml-validate.sh`) with field, enum, and path validation
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Input validation for change names to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **Guard Script Integration**: Automatic schema validation during phase transitions

### Changed

- Updated all 9 Comet skills to use `.comet.yaml` instead of `.openspec.yaml` comet: subtree
- Improved error messages with specific field values instead of generic placeholders
- Enhanced project structure documentation

### Security

- Fixed path traversal vulnerability through unvalidated change name inputs
- Schema validation now catches typos and invalid enum values at entry point
