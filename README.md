**OpenSpec + Superpowers dual-star development workflow** — one command from idea to archive.

OpenSpec handles **WHAT** (outlines, proposals, spec lifecycle, archiving).

Superpowers handles **HOW** (technical design, planning, execution, wrap-up).

Beacon chains both into a five-phase automated pipeline.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **0.3.9** — Review mode (`off|standard|thorough`) controls Build/Verify code review with project defaults; init/update now use optional dependency prompts, broader CLI i18n, stronger phase guards, and macOS executable bits.
>
> **0.3.8** — Adds Kimi Code support, safe multi-platform `beacon uninstall`, extended subagent dispatch, shared progressive-loading references, update checks, and pre-commit formatting.
>
> **0.3.7** — Adds CodeGraph semantic indexing, Beta context compression, active context compression, token optimizations, `auto_transition`, phase guards, optional TDD, and safer archive/verification flow.
>
> See [NEWS.md](NEWS.md) for details.

## Why Beacon

OpenSpec excels at managing requirements, creating proposals, managing Spec lifecycles, and archiving, but its proposals
and tasks lack the detail of Superpowers brainstorming.

Superpowers generates Spec documents after brainstorming, but these documents typically lack stateful design — after
completing requirements, Specs only have tasks checked off in the document, and Agents even forget to check them off.
This causes the Agent to re-examine documents and project code to verify on resumption, wasting many tokens.

**Beacon combines the strengths of both**, integrating the core workflow into 5 phases

The main entry `/beacon` supports current Spec state detection, suitable for long tasks — after closing your AI coding
session midway, just `/beacon` and Beacon will automatically read the active Spec (lists multiple for selection),
dynamically identify which phase is currently executing, and continue.

At the same time, Beacon provides full Spec lifecycle management. During execution, it links OpenSpec change/spec
artifacts with Superpowers design and planning documents, then automates handoff, state updates, validation, and archive
sync so users do not have to repeatedly remind the Agent to keep documents synchronized and connected.

## What You'll Learn

Many excellent Skill projects exist in the current Skill market, but they generally have preference issues — users may
only like some features. For example, when using both OpenSpec and Superpowers, one might only use OpenSpec's Spec
management capabilities, but prefer Superpowers' TDD-driven approach for coding.

Long-term Skill users know these capabilities can be freely combined, but exactly how to do so still requires real
practice. The Beacon project can serve as a reference:

- **How to reliably trigger nested Skills** — Not letting the Agent rely on document descriptions to perform "look-alike
  Skill trigger" operations (like writing files based on Skill descriptions), but truly triggering Skills (key feature:
  Skill trigger prints on CC). Beacon triggers many capabilities from OpenSpec and Superpowers. How is this Prompt
  written?

- **How to make combined Skills flow automatically across phases** — Not relying on manual intervention. Beacon's 5-phase
  flow can automatically trigger Skills for the core process except for necessary user choices, while the state machine
  also protects state transition reliability.

- **How to turn the Spec lifecycle into a resumable workflow** — Beacon links OpenSpec change/spec artifacts with
  Superpowers design and planning documents, then records phase, execution mode, verification results, and archive
  status in `.beacon.yaml`, so the Agent can resume after interruption instead of rereading documents and guessing
  progress.

- **How to turn document synchronization from "user reminders" into automation** — Beacon puts handoff, state updates,
  validation, and archive sync into scripted flows, reducing repeated prompts like "remember to update the design
  doc", "remember to sync the spec", and "remember to archive the change".

- **How to design guard conditions that Agents can execute** — Beacon does not simply trust the Agent saying "done" at
  phase exits. Scripts such as `beacon-guard.sh`, `beacon-yaml-validate.sh`, and `beacon-state.sh` check tasks, state
  fields, verification evidence, and archive conditions before allowing the workflow to advance.

- **How to distribute and install Skills across platforms** — Beacon supports first-batch private AI coding platforms,
  project/global installation, Chinese/English Skill choices, and platform-specific directory metadata. It can be a reference for CLI installers and Skill package
  structure.

- **How to turn shell scripts into Agent workflow infrastructure** — Beacon's scripts need to work across macOS, Linux,
  and Windows Git Bash while handling hashes, YAML fields, state machines, and archive flows. It shows how to move
  fragile workflow control out of scattered Prompt text and into testable, reusable tools.

## Install

Requirements:

- Node.js 20+
- npm/npx
- Git
- Bash-compatible shell for workflow scripts (Windows users should use Git Bash or an equivalent bash environment)

```bash
npm install -g beacon
```

## Quick Start

```bash
cd your-project
beacon init
```

`beacon init` will:

1. Prompt you to select AI platforms (auto-detects existing configs)
2. Choose install scope: project-level (current directory) or global (home directory)
3. Select language for Beacon skills: English or 中文
4. Select npm dependencies to install/upgrade — [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) CLI, [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) (via `npx skills add`), and [CodeGraph](https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph) CLI. Items not yet detected default to checked; already-installed items default to unchecked so you can opt in to upgrades.
5. Install the selected dependencies and deploy their skills
6. Deploy Beacon skills (in your chosen language) to selected platforms
7. Create `docs/superpowers/specs/` and `docs/superpowers/plans/` working directories for project-scope installs

> [!TIP]
> Superpowers v6.0.0+ is recommended — about 2× faster and ~50% fewer tokens than older versions.
> To upgrade Beacon itself later: `beacon update` or `npm install -g beacon@latest`.

## Manual Skills CLI Installation

Outside the first-batch private `beacon init` platforms, tools that use the generic `skills` CLI directly can still install the Beacon skill package manually:

```bash
npx skills add rpamis/beacon
```

</details>

### OpenSpec Skills

Spec lifecycle management: propose, explore, sync, verify, archive, and more.

### Superpowers Skills

Development methodology: brainstorming, TDD, subagent-driven development, code review, plan writing, and more.

## Workflow

```
/beacon
  ↓ auto-detect
/beacon-open  -->  /beacon-design  -->  /beacon-build  -->  /beacon-verify  -->  /beacon-archive
(OpenSpec)         (Superpowers)       (Superpowers)       (Both)           (OpenSpec)

/beacon-hotfix (preset path, skips brainstorming)
  open  -->  build  -->  verify  -->  archive

/beacon-tweak (preset path, skips brainstorming and full plan)
  open  -->  lightweight build  -->  light verify  -->  archive
```

### Five Phases

| Phase              | Command          | Owner       | Artifacts                            |
|--------------------|------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1. Open            | `/beacon-open`    | OpenSpec    | proposal.md, design.md, tasks.md     |
| 2. Deep Design     | `/beacon-design`  | Superpowers | Design Doc, delta spec               |
| 3. Plan & Build    | `/beacon-build`   | Superpowers | Implementation plan, code commits    |
| 4. Verify & Finish | `/beacon-verify`  | Both        | Verification report, branch handling |
| 5. Archive         | `/beacon-archive` | OpenSpec    | delta→main spec sync, archive        |

### Core Principles

- **Brainstorming is non-skippable** — every change must go through deep design (except hotfix/tweak)
- **Delta specs are living documents** — freely editable during Phase 3, synced at archive
- **Keep tasks.md in sync** — check off each task as completed
- **Commit frequently** — one commit per task, message reflects design intent
- **Verify before archive** — `/beacon-verify` must pass before `/beacon-archive`

### State Management

Beacon uses a decoupled state architecture with separate YAML files:

| File             | Owner    | Purpose                                             |
|------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `.openspec.yaml` | OpenSpec | Spec lifecycle, change metadata                     |
| `.beacon.yaml`    | Beacon    | Workflow phase, execution mode, verification status |

All states and execution phases are updated via scripts, and each phase verifies that tasks are truly complete before
advancing. Compared to storing complex state rules only in Skill text, this script-backed state machine gives Beacon more
reliable phase transitions, correct YAML, and easier breakpoint recovery; agents can read the current Spec situation
through Beacon's built-in commands.

<details>
<summary>View key .beacon.yaml fields</summary>

**Key Fields in `.beacon.yaml`:**

```yaml
workflow: full
auto_transition: true
phase: build
build_mode: subagent-driven-development
build_pause: null
isolation: branch
verify_mode: null
tdd_mode: null
subagent_dispatch: null
design_doc: docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-topic-design.md
plan: docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature.md
verify_result: pending
verification_report: null
branch_status: pending
verified_at: null
archived: false
direct_override: false
build_command: null
verify_command: null
handoff_context: openspec/changes/<name>/.beacon/handoff/design-context.json
handoff_hash: <sha256>
```

In full workflow, `build_mode`, `build_pause`, `isolation`, `verify_mode`, `tdd_mode`, and `subagent_dispatch` may
temporarily be `null`; `build_mode` and `isolation` must be resolved before `build → verify`. `auto_transition` controls automatic vs manual skill invocation after phase completion — see [AUTO-TRANSITION.md](docs/AUTO-TRANSITION.md). `build_pause` records an internal build-phase pause point:
`null` means no pause, while `plan-ready` means the plan has been generated and the user paused before choosing
isolation and execution mode. It is not an execution mode and must not be written into `build_mode`.
`verification_report` stays `null` until verification writes a report, and `verify-pass` requires that report to exist
plus `branch_status: handled`. Fields after `archived` in the example are optional or script-derived: `direct_override`
is only needed for full-workflow direct builds, project commands may be absent unless configured, and
`handoff_context` / `handoff_hash` are recorded by `beacon-handoff.sh` before leaving design. Projects can configure
`build_command` / `verify_command` in the change or repo root, and guard will run those commands first and print failure
output.

</details>

### Reliability Features

Beacon ensures agent execution reliability through automated state transitions:

<details>
<summary>View reliability features</summary>

1. **Entry Verification** — Each phase validates preconditions before execution
    - Checks file existence, state consistency, and phase transitions
    - Outputs `[HARD STOP]` with actionable suggestions if validation fails

2. **Automated State Transitions** — `beacon-guard.sh --apply` updates `.beacon.yaml` automatically
    - All phase transitions (open → design/build → verify → archive) use `guard --apply`
    - No manual state editing required — eliminates write-verification errors
    - `beacon-state.sh` is the agents' exclusive interface for state operations
    - Guard and archive scripts use `beacon-state.sh` internally for state management

3. **Schema Validation** — `beacon-yaml-validate.sh` ensures data integrity
    - Validates required and optional fields
    - Validates enum values, including `direct_override`
    - Validates `design_doc`, `plan`, and `handoff_context` paths exist, plus `handoff_hash` format
    - Detects unknown/typos fields

4. **Build Decision Enforcement** — Guard and state transitions both block skipped build choices
    - `isolation` must be `branch` or `worktree`
    - `build_mode` must be selected before leaving build
    - `build_pause: plan-ready` is a recoverable pause after plan generation, not a `build_mode`
    - Full workflow `build_mode: direct` requires `direct_override: true`

5. **Verification Evidence** — Guard enforces proof before phase advance
    - `verify-pass` transition requires `verification_report` pointing to an existing report file
    - `branch_status` must be `handled` before verify can pass
    - Guard checks `verification_report exists` and `branch_status=handled` as hard prerequisites
    - Prevents false phase advances when verification or branch handling was skipped

6. **Archive Automation** — `beacon-archive.sh` handles the full archive flow in one command
    - Validates entry state, merges delta specs into main specs through OpenSpec
    - Annotates design doc and plan frontmatter
    - Moves change to archive directory and updates `archived: true`
    - Supports `--dry-run` for preview

<details>
<summary>Context Compression (Beta)</summary>

Beacon supports context compression at the Design → Build handoff. When enabled, `beacon-handoff.sh` generates a compact
context package that reduces Build-phase input tokens by **25–30%** without affecting implementation correctness.

| Mode   | Behavior                                 | Token Savings |
|--------|------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `off`  | Full Spec excerpts in handoff context    | Baseline      |
| `beta` | Design Doc + SHA256 hash references only | ~25–30%       |

Key findings from benchmark testing:

- **Test pass rate**: 100% across all tiers (compression does not affect correctness)
- **Spec coverage**: 100% (off) vs 95% (beta) — minor edge-case detail loss
- **Scaling**: Larger tasks yield higher absolute savings (up to 15,000 tokens for large-tier tasks)

Enable in `.beacon/config.yaml`: `context_compression: beta`

<summary>Auto Transition</summary>

`auto_transition` controls whether Beacon automatically invokes the next skill after a phase completes, or pauses for
manual handoff. Phase advancement itself always happens — this setting only affects skill invocation.

| Value  | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `true` | Auto-invoke the next skill after each phase (default) |
| `false` | Pause after each phase; user manually triggers the next skill |

Three-layer configuration with precedence: `BEACON_AUTO_TRANSITION` env var > `.beacon/config.yaml` (project) > `.beacon.yaml` (change).

See [AUTO-TRANSITION.md](docs/AUTO-TRANSITION.md) for configuration details, workflow mapping, and FAQ.
