# Comet Preset Path: Hotfix

Hotfix is a preset workflow of Comet's five-phase capabilities, not a separate parallel process. It reuses open, build, verify, archive capabilities, only skipping brainstorming and full plan.

Applicable for bug fixes, hotfixes, small-scale behavior corrections. Does not involve new capability design, does not require deep brainstorming.

**Applicable conditions** (all must be met):
1. Fix bugs in existing functionality, no new capability
2. No interface changes or architecture adjustments
3. Change scope is predictable (usually < 5 files)

**Not applicable**: If fix process discovers need for architecture adjustments, should upgrade to full `/comet` workflow.

---

## Process (preset workflow, 4 phases)

### 0. Entry State Verification (Entry Check)

Execute entry verification:

```bash
COMET_STATE="${COMET_STATE:-$(find . -path '*/comet/scripts/comet-state.sh' -type f -print -quit)}"
bash "$COMET_STATE" check <name> open
```

Proceed to process steps after verification passes. The script outputs specific failure reasons when verification fails.

Execution chain: open → build → verify → archive. Hotfix provides default decisions for each phase: streamlined open, direct build, scale-based verification, archive after verification passes.

### 1. Quick Open (preset open)

Reuse Comet open capability to create change, but use hotfix defaults: do not execute `openspec-explore` long exploration, directly enter streamlined change creation.

**Immediately execute:** Use the Skill tool to load the `openspec-new-change` skill. Skipping this step is prohibited.

After the skill loads, follow its guidance to create streamlined artifacts:
  - `proposal.md` — problem description + root cause analysis + fix goal (no solution comparison needed)
  - `design.md` — fix solution (one is enough, no multi-solution comparison needed)
  - `tasks.md` — fix task list
- **No delta spec needed** (unless fix changes existing spec acceptance scenarios)

Initialize Comet state file:

```bash
bash "$COMET_STATE" init <name> hotfix
```

### 2. Direct Build (preset build)

Use hotfix defaults: `build_mode: direct`. Skip `superpowers:brainstorming` and `superpowers:writing-plans` (unless tasks > 3; if exceeds 3 tasks, transfer to `/comet-build`'s plan and execution method selection).

**Immediately execute:** Execute tasks one by one according to tasks.md:

1. Read `openspec/changes/<name>/tasks.md`, get incomplete task list
2. For each incomplete task:
   - Modify code according to task description
   - Run project formatter (e.g., `mvn spotless:apply`, `npm run format`)
   - Run related tests to confirm pass
   - Check corresponding `- [ ]` to `- [x]` in tasks.md
   - Commit code, commit message format: `fix: <brief fix description>`
3. After all tasks complete, enter verification

**If fix affects existing spec acceptance scenarios**:
- Create delta spec in `openspec/changes/<name>/specs/<capability>/spec.md`
- Only include `## MODIFIED Requirements` section

### 3. Verification (preset verify)

Reuse `/comet-verify`, with comet-verify's scale assessment deciding lightweight or full verification.

**Immediately execute:** Use the Skill tool to load the `comet-verify` skill. Skipping this step is prohibited.

Small-scale hotfixes without delta spec usually meet lightweight verification conditions (≤ 3 tasks, ≤ 5 files), comet-verify's scale assessment will select lightweight verification path (5 quick checks). If hotfix created delta spec, enter full verification path according to comet-verify's scale assessment rules.

**Additional Hotfix-Exclusive Checks** (execute after comet-verify lightweight verification passes):

1. **Root cause elimination**: Compare proposal.md's root cause analysis, confirm problem code eliminated
   - Read bug description and root cause in proposal.md
   - Search and verify problem code no longer exists
   - If root cause not eliminated, return to Step 2 to continue fix

**Verification phase upgrade conditions**:
- Regression testing reveals deep architecture issues → Stop hotfix, upgrade to `/comet`
- Fix requires additional interface changes → Stop hotfix, upgrade to `/comet`

After verification passes, record `.comet.yaml` `verify_result` as `pass` according to `/comet-verify` rules, must not skip this status before archiving.

### 4. Archive (preset archive)

Reuse `/comet-archive`. Must satisfy `verify_result: pass` in `.comet.yaml` before archiving.

**Immediately execute:** Use the Skill tool to load the `comet-archive` skill to archive. Skipping this step is prohibited.
If there is delta spec, sync to main spec according to comet-archive rules, and handle associated Design Doc and Plan archiving annotations.

---

## Continuous Execution Mode

<IMPORTANT>
Hotfix workflow is **one-time continuous execution**. After invoking `/comet-hotfix`, agent must automatically complete all 4 phases, without pausing to wait for user input mid-way (unless encountering upgrade conditions requiring user confirmation).

Execution order: quick open → direct build → verification → archive → complete

After each phase completes, immediately enter next phase, no need for user input again. Within each phase, must still call corresponding Comet/OpenSpec/Superpowers skill according to above requirements.
</IMPORTANT>

## Upgrade Conditions

Upgrade to full `/comet` when **any** of the following conditions are met:

| Condition | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Change involves **3+ files** | Exceeds single-point fix scope |
| Architecture changes | New modules, new interfaces, new dependencies |
| Database schema changes | Structural adjustments |
| Introduces new public API | Fix creates new external interface |
| Fix scope exceeds single function/module | Requires coordinated changes |

Upgrade method: On current change basis, supplement Design Doc (execute `/comet-design`), then proceed normally with full workflow.

---

## Exit Conditions

- Bug fixed, tests pass
- Change archived
- If spec changes, synced to main spec
- **Phase guard**: Before build → verify run `bash $COMET_GUARD <change-name> build`, before verify → archive run `bash $COMET_GUARD <change-name> verify`
