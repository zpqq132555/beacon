# beacon-hook-guard.sh — PreToolUse hook for Beacon phase enforcement
#
# Blocks file writes (Write/Edit) when the active Beacon change is in
# a phase that does not allow source code modifications (open/design/archive).
#
# Usage (called by harness, not directly):
#   PreToolUse matcher "Write|Edit" → this script
#   Stdin:  JSON  {"tool_name":"Write|Edit","tool_input":{"file_path":"..."}}
#   Exit 0  = allow
#   Exit 2  = blocked (stderr message shown to user)
